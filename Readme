My Experimental Unity build of Q-Learning to navigate Unknown spaces.
Paper is attached.

This was used to test how practical a basic form of Q-Learning is for
games instead of pre-programming all of their navigation functions.
In terms of success this ranged from very successful to not as successful,
this came about two problems: the agents wouldn't update their entire path
if they reached the gaol and the flooring method used would cause the
agent to break on corners and create large negative spaces relative to
their enviroment. This meant they would block their access to the exit doors,
creating an infinite loop and couldn't break it because the flooring method
would reset their path. However, this method does work in open spaces. As
the method stops it from leaning on the boundaries leaving about two to three
tiles depending on the map size.
